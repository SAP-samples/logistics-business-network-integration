The goal of this page is to provide a description of the required steps and the required sequence of the same, in order to integrate against SAP Business Network for Logistics APIs. Therefore the content is targeting the developer persona, that has mostly worked as an integration specialist. The description is valid for both, SAP Business Network Freight Collaboration (FC), as well as SAP Business Network Global Track and Trace (GTT).

Questions can be raised via the GitHub issues section within this repository. The issues section is being monitored actively - [**ask a question**](https://github.com/SAP-samples/logistics-business-network-integration/issues) and please also check the [FAQ section](https://github.com/SAP-samples/logistics-business-network-integration/wiki/FAQ).
You might also want to take a look at the below [glossary](https://github.com/SAP-samples/logistics-business-network-integration#glossary).

## 2.) Request B2B test tenant and test technical user
![](Upload/Resources/2.png)

Before you can actually start connecting against SAP Business Network for Logistics, you need to request the two below items:
- Request B2B test tenant
- Request test technical user

### 2.1) Request B2B test tenant

As a prerequisit for connecting to / integrating with SAP Business Network for Logistics APIs,
you are required to have tenants in SAP Business Network for Logistics available which are specific to your company.

For this you will have to request two tenants, one that will serve the development and test purposes,
and a second one for productive usage.

This section focuses on requesting the development/test tenant.
Section 5 will guide you through requesting your productive tenant.

![](Upload/Screenshot3.png) 

#### A. Tenant and License description ###

License Nr 8007828 â€“ Free of Charge *Test tenant to develop & test connectivity with standard SAP Business Network for Logistics APIs* 
* For carrier/partner integration phase: mapping to SAP Business Network for Logistics APIs and end-to-end testing for both SAP Business Network Freight Collaboration & Global Track and Trace  
* Also for customer testing/implementation project with testing of integration to the partner network

![](Upload/Screenshot.png)

#### B. License coverage details
* SAP Business Network for Logistics B2B Test Tenant for carriers and network partners
* License to set-up B2B connections for
  * Mapping to SAP Business Network for Logistics standard APIs

* Related usage of SAP Cloud Identity and SAP Fiori
* Standard SAP cloud support for SAP Business Network for Logistics and standard APIs

#### C. Requesting the B2B test tenant 

Please request your B2B test tenant via following URL: https://store.sap.com/dcp/en/configure/vc/product/entityKey/000000000008900523?LIC_READONLY_ATTRIBUTES=LIC_RENEWAL_TYPE,LIC_EDITION&LIC_HIDE_ATTRIBUTES=LIC_EU_ACCESS&LIC_START_DATE=TODAY&LIC_EDITION=TESTTENANT&LIC_DURATION_SEL=12&LIC_RENEWAL_TYPE=AUTO&reset=true

<!-- Original Link :https://www.sapstore.com/solutions/46401/SAP-Logistics-Business-Network%2C-B2B-test-tenant . -->

> By default, B2B test tenants use data centers in Europe. If you want your tenant to use a data center in the U.S., enter US20 in the PO-Number field on the Review Order Details page.

#### D. Configuring the B2B test tenant

To perform the remaining configurations of your B2B test tenant please follow the content of the following [document](https://help.sap.com/viewer/b29693ac52074747b7010a02932fe47d/LBN/en-US). This contains important settings, like for example enabling business partner entry and discovery in the business partner directory.

### 2.2) Request test technical user

>[!NOTE]
> The below steps are only relevant for old carriers who use *Neo* as the Integration platform option for inbound communication into BNL.
>
> For all the SAP Business Network for Logistics provider APIs (inbound to SAP Business Network for Logistics), when you call our endpoint, you would need to  procure an OAuth 2.0 client ID and secret. This can be procured by reporting an incident. Use the application component SBN-LBN-INT in [SAP support portal](https://support.sap.com/). Please mention the SAP Business Network for Logistics ID created for your account and the email address you want to recieve your client ID and secret at. To know the SAP Business Network for Logistics ID, login to SAP LBN  and open the manage business profile tile. Additionally, please mention the LBN API endpoints you intend to connect in the incident. The list is mentioned below
>* Provider API for Freight Booking
>* Provider API for Freight Subcontracting
>* Provider API for Freight Tendering
>* Provider API for Invoicing
>* Provider API for Order Events

> [!IMPORTANT]
>If you are a new carrier or a carrier who is currently building integration, you do not need to request for a technical user as described above, but rather can create it yourself by following the steps below:
>1. Go to *System Connections* application. 
>2. Click on *Connection Settings*. 
>3. In the Inbound section, choose *Multi-Cloud* as the Integration Platform.
>4. Choose the scenarios that you need access for.
>5. Click *Save* (You will see a warning dialog, click *Yes* to proceed).
>On Save, the dialog is closed and you can click on *Connection Settings* again and this time, it should show an option to see the Service Credentials.
>You will see *Client ID, Client Secret* and *Authentication URL* that you can now use for calling BNL.


## 3.) Integrate with SAP Business Network for Logistics APIs

![](Upload/Resources/3.png)

You may use these [postman sample payloads](Upload/SamplePayload/) to build your mappings and endpoints.

Once your APIs are ready, you can configure the endpoints to our test landscape. To configure them, you will have to login to SAP Business Network for Logistics and maintain your endpoints that SAP Business Network for Logistics needs to call.
You may refere to this [video](https://www.kaltura.com/p/1921661/sp/192166100/embedIframeJs/uiconf_id/37285991/partner_id/1921661?iframeembed=true&playerId=kaltura_player&entry_id=1_79ppqap7) to view how to setup outbound connections and inbound connections, as well as this [documentation](https://help.sap.com/viewer/185742008f2c477ca789b93675b0ec6c/LBN/en-US/011fbcd85017450587389c4a10190077.html).

The OAuth Id and secret that you requested earlier, will be needed by you to call our endpoint for all the provider APIs.

This is the [SAP Business Network for Logistics endpoint](https://l20398-iflmap.hcisbp.eu1.hana.ondemand.com/http/v1h) that you need to call: https://l20398-iflmap.hcisbp.eu1.hana.ondemand.com/http/v1 .

## 4.) Testing 

![](Upload/Resources/4.png)

To test, you can generate a test call from the system connection app. You may refer the document [here](https://help.sap.com/viewer/185742008f2c477ca789b93675b0ec6c/LBN/en-US/21f87b4b5d1547a5b7c185be5e764203.html) on how to generate a test payload.
